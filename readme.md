# JSPong
A simple pong game made in JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
Originally coded in 2-3 hours out of boredom in 2021, but I had to optimize it a bit and fix some bugs so that it is playable.
## How to play
You can play the game [here](https://jspong.gamersi.at/). You can also download the files and open the index.html file in your browser.
## Controls
arrow up: move paddle up
arrow down: move paddle down
on mobile: touch the screen and depending on where you touch, the paddle will move up or down. if you touch the upper half of the screen, the paddle will move up. if you touch the lower half of the screen, the paddle will move down.
The right paddle is controlled by an AI. you can make it harder by changing "opAI" in localStorage to "true".
